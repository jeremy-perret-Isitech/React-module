### React Module Isitech
this is 2 project i have done during this week.
"react-ts-app" this project is based on the basics of React tool.
"react-chakra-ui-app" is a project made with a css framework on top of react, as well as more advanced principles, such as HTTP requests with Axios, and the use of a router.
